# Sudoku Solver
 Sudoku Solver Algorithm, developed while taking CSE30 at UCSC

Contains implementation for a SAT-style Sudoku Solver. Was developed as an assignment for CSE30, Python and Programming Abstractions at
University of California, Santa Cruz. Some of the code provided in the assignment was pre-written by course staff. However, the majority
of the core function was developed by me.
